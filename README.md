# ðŸ¤– AI-ATS Resume Analyzer

**AI-ATS Resume Analyzer** is an intelligent screening tool that leverages NLP techniques and uses OpenAI's API to evaluate how well a resume aligns with a job description. Built with Python, React, FastAPI, and OpenAI API, it aims to simulate an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) and help job seekers optimize their resumes for better results. This project helps bridge the gap between human-written resumes and automated job screening systems, making it easier for applicants to tailor their applications with data-driven insights.
